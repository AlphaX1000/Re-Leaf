The Usage of Fan Power as Stated During the Meeting was to Cover the Exact Same distance of Air throw with Less Active Fan's ,not to Exclude any direction .Use of Relays to control 
Fan speed reduced to suction Force ,We can use cyclone model of Forces to work with efficiency and low power high area cover ,The umbrella of cyclone can be the throwing area and
suction from around the Tower
Or I say we are actually making a huge virtual Fan thriugh its Wind Pressure points through Small Fans
I'm Planning for whole Cylindrical Body from Downwards as filter and use upper as creating a cyclone .The Theory also says that its better to take air as vents from ground ,rather than fom top

Why not use the model of Perpectual Motion , But when the flaw part comes we charge bust it with the lost power after every cycle .

I need to do an experiment with Panted wind traversing Far from which method the direct method ,or the cycloning method ,with same amount of force outburst
